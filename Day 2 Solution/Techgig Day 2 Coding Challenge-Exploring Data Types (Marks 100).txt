Techgig Day 2 Coding Challenge : Exploring Data Types (Marks 100)

* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print your output to STDOUT.
* Your class should be named CandidateCode.

Exploring Data Types (100 Marks)

For this challenge, you need to read a line from stdin and check whether it is of type integer, float or string.

If input is-
   --> Integer print 'This input is of type Integer.' to the stdout
